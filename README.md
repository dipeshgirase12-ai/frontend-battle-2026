## About

NexusAI turns complex data workflow steps into a cohesive, AI-driven automation layer.

**Built for:** teams and builders who need faster throughput—without sacrificing reliability.

**Why this exists:** to provide a modern, SEO-clean, motion-rich landing experience with strict UI constraints (no banned component/animation libraries, semantic HTML first, and fast first-load orchestration).

---

## What’s Included (Key Highlights)

### Pricing & Currency Engine (Matrix-Driven)
- Monthly / Annual billing toggle
- Multi-currency display: **USD ($)**, **INR (₹)**, **EUR (€)**
- Dynamic computation via configuration matrix:
  - base tier rate
  - **20% annual discount**
  - regional tariff adjustments (per currency)
- Native formatting via `Intl.NumberFormat` with correct fractional rules (INR rounds to whole currency units)

### Bento Features → Mobile Accordion (Context Lock)
- Desktop: modern **Bento grid** feature nodes
- Mobile: touch-optimized **Accordion** refactor
- **Context Lock constraint:** when crossing the breakpoint during active interaction, the corresponding index context is preserved and the matching mobile panel opens smoothly.
- Animations use hardware-friendly **native CSS transitions**.

### SEO / Semantic HTML / Metadata
- Next.js `metadata` for:
  - title template + description
  - OpenGraph + Twitter cards
  - canonical URL + robots configuration
- JSON-LD structured data injected into the document head
- Semantic sections for crawlability and accessibility.

## UI / UX Notes (Constraints honored)

- **No banned UI libraries**: the accordion and motion are implemented from scratch.
- **No runtime animation engines**: motion is handled with native CSS transitions.
- **State isolation focus (Pricing):** updates are scoped to localized DOM text nodes where prices are rendered.
- **Breakpoint refactor (Features):** desktop Bento and mobile Accordion use the same underlying `activeIndex` context.

---

## Performance & SEO

- Metadata-first rendering via Next.js `metadata`.
- Crawlable, semantic structure: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`.
- Entry and micro-interactions use short, targeted durations (kept under the orchestration cap).

---

## Accessibility

- Buttons and controls include appropriate ARIA attributes (`aria-expanded`, `aria-checked`, etc.).
- Focus states are visible using Tailwind focus-visible ring utilities.
- Accordion panels expose `role="region"` and `aria-controls` associations.
